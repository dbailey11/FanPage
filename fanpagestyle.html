        <h3>Bio</h3>

        <p>Led Zeppelin got their start back in 1969. Originator of the band, Jimmy Page, was the former guitarist for Yardbird. Other members of the band included The Who's former drummer Keith Moon, John bonham and John Paul Jones. The name originated from a joke after Page wanted to be called "The New Yardbirds" and Moon's remark was that the band would go down like a "lead zeppelin". Their music was known for mixing blues, folk and eastern influences making them increasingly huge throughout the US and UK during their first four albums. Popular songs include: 'Black Dog', 'Dazed and Confused', 'Stairway To Heaven', and 'Kashmir'</p>
        <p>As the 70's came to an end things got darker for the band. Members got involved in drugs and alcohol. Bonham, after a night of binge drinking, died at Page's house. Though the band is no longer together their music lives on. </p>
